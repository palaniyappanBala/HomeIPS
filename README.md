# HomeIPS
a simplified but powerfull Intrusion Prevention System for home users


**Some general information about the project:**

At the moment we're still working hard on improving our code as well as our documentation. We're still in a proof-of-concept phase and we hope to publicise things like setup scripts, more installation tutorials and more elaborate configuration soon. 

The final product will have to be able to configure itself (in combination with a centralized server where it'll pull its configuration from), to minimize user interaction. All hardcoded IP's or settings are still for testing purposes and will soon be automated :)

We're currently only officially supporting arm architectures and Debian based distributions.
Allthough we're pretty sure everything will run just fine on i386 and amd64 architectures we've only tested our solution on the Raspberry Pi in combination with Raspian (Debian Wheezy).
Also note that the tutorials that can be found on this Wiki are specifically written for the Raspberry Pi.
